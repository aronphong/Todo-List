# ToDo List in JavaScript

A project from [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/todo-list) curriculum, creating a ToDo List project to learn to vanilla Javascript and utilize concepts I have learned so far.

## Things I learned
* Separating DOM related functions and backend logic into separate modules

## Things to work on
* Expand a single todo item to see/edit its details
* Use localStorage to save user's projects and todos between sessions
* Add capability to store date with reminders
